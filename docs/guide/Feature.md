Mogan Editor inherits all the above features from GNU TeXmacs (see [the homepage of GNU TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org)), so it can also be used as a efficient study tool for students, teachers, and researchers in science and technology, and suitable to create high-quality assignment documents, report slides, and LaTeX-level papers. Based on GNU TeXmacs, Mogan has more bugs fixed, performance-optimized, and the interface beautified.
