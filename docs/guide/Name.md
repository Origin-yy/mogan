## The Name "Mogan"
[Darcy Shen](http://texmacs.org/tmweb/contribute/team-sadhen.en.html):
> Mogan is named after [Mount Mogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mogan), a famous attraction in my hometown. 墨干(Mogan) literally means "dried ink". The word is derived from 莫干(Mogan) which is a combination of [莫(Mo) and 干(Gan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Jiang_and_Mo_Ye).
